You aren’t here for me.  You’re more interested in Max, Kiera or perhaps Riley.  I’m not a hero.  I’m not the savior of everything.  I’m not even a very nice person.  In the end I’m just a guy with a shitty life, trying to make it a little less shitty every day.  The only thing that sets me apart from anyone else is that I want to do it without making someone else’s life worse.</p><p>I’m also a stubborn asshole.  With all I’ve been through, a lot of people probably would have given up by now.  I’ve picked fights I couldn’t win, been beaten to within moments of my life, and none of it matters because as soon as someone figures out I’m a god it’ll all end in one spectacular instant when my head gets blown clean off.</p><p>Yet no matter what I do, how much suffering I endure, no matter how much I get stomped on or covered in shit, there’s this annoying, vague, nubile sprout of hope that just keeps poking up out of the mud.  For some stupid reason it just won’t die.</p><p>And so I keep trying.</p>"

        "text": "<p>EEEEEEEEEE!!! That’s Kiva! Oh, man, you guys, he’s SO COOL.  And he’s sweet and kind and soft and handsome and his spots are SO BEAUTIFUL and he’s just the greatest guy EVER.</p><p>Did I ever tell you guys how I met him?  OMG, so get this okay?  So I’m walking along, and… um… cuz some stuff just happened, and I’m feeling kinda down, right?  And I see him digging through a pile of stuff, and my eyes just fall on his back, cuz like… I’ve never seen anyone with so many spots before!  Like… okay, he had his shirt off… And I’m sitting there staring, and it was probably kinda rude, but he finally notices me and he whirls around and steps up all threatening like, right?  And then he’s like, “WHAT ARE YOU STARING AT?” in his big scary Kiva voice, you know?  So, I kinda just break down and start crying, because at that point I’m terrified he’s gonna hurt me, cuz I didn’t know him, and cuz that’s like… anyway...  So instead he feels really bad about it, and he just sits down with me and we start talking and I just prolly go on and on for hours, spilling my whole life’s story to him and he just kinda… listens.  And see… nobody’s ever done that before… or since, actually… And when I’m done crying and talking I look at him, and I just get lost into his big beautiful eyes, and I just kinda… lean in to kiss him.  But then he pushes me over, cuz like… yeah, it was a bit much, I’ll admit.  I don’t normally… DO stuff like that… but it was just… I dunno!  Anyway, after that, he walks with me back to the Twirl, cuz like… Kiva was MAD after all that stuff I told him, and he was about to punch someone I think… but by then Gilly’s calmed down and he’s being really nice to me all of a sudden?  And he kinda pulled me off to the side and Kiva didn’t want me to go with him, but I did cuz like… he had all my stuff… and like… it sounded like a pretty good deal the way he was going on about it… so… that’s… a whole thing now… But anyway, Kiva and I kept kinda meeting up every once in awhile, just for like, going out for food and drinks and stuff… Before we knew it, we were hanging out almost every day!  Usually for drinks… and well, I don’t drink, but Kiva does, he drinks a LOT.  Wait… I shouldn’t really… um...</p><p>Anyway, Kiva is awesome, I’ve seen him fight a couple of times, he’s AMAZING!  He kicks the tails of anyone who steps up… if… er… when he’s sober.  And I just… I dunno… I feel really safe when he’s around.  Not like… um… well, he makes me feel safe.  That’s all.</p>"
