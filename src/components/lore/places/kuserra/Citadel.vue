    <h2>The Citadel</h2>
    <p>
      In the center of Kuserra, there stands a massive, mysterious structure
      with architecture starkly different from the surrounding wreckage.
      Whatever befell the region during the Catastrophe seems to have left the
      structure largely unscathed, though several massive, gaping wounds in its
      walls continue to glow and leak some mysterious chemicals. A long time
      ago, people started calling this structure the Citadel, because it
      resembled an impregnable fortress of unknown function.

      What purpose the Citadel once served is anyone’s guess. Some believe it to
      be a massive tomb for the Ancestors, a marker for their final resting
      place or perhaps the fortress from which they made their last stand before
      civilization fell to ruin. There are some who view it as a religious
      monument, and some have even suggested it was a vehicle of some sort, but
      most people generally regard the Citadel to be little more than a
      curiosity. To most, it is useful as a massive landmark by which one can
      orient themself in the city, and little else.

      While some have been inspired to make the difficult attempt to reach the
      Citadel, nearly everyone that returns comes back empty-handed, complaining
      loudly about what a wasted effort the journey was. There are rumors that
      the Citadel is filled with treasure and watts beyond one’s wildest
      imagination, but that the Citadel itself is completely impenetrable,
      protected by some form of powerful magic barrier that prevents anyone from
      even touching it.
