      <h2>Gods</h2>
      <p>
        There’s a lot of stories about what these “gods” are and where they come
        from. The most popular legend in Kuserra is that some time after the
        Catastrophe, when some children started being born with Vim, they were
        worshipped for a time, treated as divine saviors sent to uplift everyone
        out of the squalid ruin. As one might imagine, this went poorly, and
        these so-called gods used their powers irresponsibly. Tyranny begot
        unrest, unrest soon turned into a violent uprising that saw the gods
        slaughtering thousands of dissenters, for there were none who could face
        them in the open. The chaos ended when the gods were murdered in secret
        by clandestine agents that were then called the “Slayers.” Any surviving
        gods were driven into hiding, and shortly thereafter the world settled
        into its current state. So it is said.

        Whether or not the legend has any truth to it, these days the term “god”
        is a curse word. Gods are blamed for everything from stillborn babies to
        a bad turn of cards. Their deaths are often celebrated as a sign of good
        fortune. Those called Hunters have inherited the practice of hunting and
        killing gods, with the public’s support, and they have gotten very good
        at it. Most people don’t worry too much about gods in their day to day
        lives, because should a god be revealed, it is almost certain to be
        killed within minutes. Very few gods seem to survive a decade or more,
        lending credibility to the saying that gods live very short lives. Most
        people would call it a solved problem.

        However, to anyone paying attention, the frequency of gods in the city
        seems to be trending up, not down. Furthermore, Kuserra is huge,
        stretching in all directions with countless hiding places and a vast,
        cavernous underground. A god could easily live in secret, hesitant to
        unleash their Vim for fear of revealing their identity. Vim has also
        proven itself to be a very potent and varied power, with different gods
        capable of everything from reversing time to raising the dead. The right
        god in the right place with the right Vim could change
        <i>everything</i>.
