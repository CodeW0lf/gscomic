You aren’t here for me.  You’re more interested in Max, Kiera or perhaps Riley.  I’m not a hero.  I’m not the savior of everything.  I’m not even a very nice person.  In the end I’m just a guy with a shitty life, trying to make it a little less shitty every day.  The only thing that sets me apart from anyone else is that I want to do it without making someone else’s life worse.</p><p>I’m also a stubborn asshole.  With all I’ve been through, a lot of people probably would have given up by now.  I’ve picked fights I couldn’t win, been beaten to within moments of my life, and none of it matters because as soon as someone figures out I’m a god it’ll all end in one spectacular instant when my head gets blown clean off.</p><p>Yet no matter what I do, how much suffering I endure, no matter how much I get stomped on or covered in shit, there’s this annoying, vague, nubile sprout of hope that just keeps poking up out of the mud.  For some stupid reason it just won’t die.</p><p>And so I keep trying.</p>"

And he’s sweet and kind and soft and handsome and his spots are SO BEAUTIFUL and he’s just the greatest guy EVER.</p><p>Did I ever tell you guys how I met him?  OMG, so get this okay?  So I’m walking along, and… um… cuz some stuff just happened, and I’m feeling kinda down, right?  And I see him digging through a pile of stuff, and my eyes just fall on his back, cuz like… I’ve never seen anyone with so many spots before!  Like… okay, he had his shirt off… And I’m sitting there staring, and it was probably kinda rude, but he finally notices me and he whirls around and steps up all threatening like, right?  And then he’s like, “WHAT ARE YOU STARING AT?” in his big scary Kiva voice, you know?  So, I kinda just break down and start crying, because at that point I’m terrified he’s gonna hurt me, cuz I didn’t know him, and cuz that’s like… anyway...  So instead he feels really bad about it, and he just sits down with me and we start talking and I just prolly go on and on for hours, spilling my whole life’s story to him and he just kinda… listens.  And see… nobody’s ever done that before… or since, actually… And when I’m done crying and talking I look at him, and I just get lost into his big beautiful eyes, and I just kinda… lean in to kiss him.  But then he pushes me over, cuz like… yeah, it was a bit much, I'll admit.  I don’t normally… DO stuff like that… but it was just… I dunno!  Anyway, after that, he walks with me back to the Twirl, cuz like… Kiva was MAD after all that stuff I told him, and he was about to punch someone I think… but by then Gilly’s calmed down and he’s being really nice to me all of a sudden?  And he kinda pulled me off to the side and Kiva didn’t want me to go with him, but I did cuz like… he had all my stuff… and like… it sounded like a pretty good deal the way he was going on about it… so… that’s… a whole thing now… But anyway, Kiva and I kept kinda meeting up every once in awhile, just for like, going out for food and drinks and stuff… Before we knew it, we were hanging out almost every day!  Usually for drinks… and well, I don’t drink, but Kiva does, he drinks a LOT.  Wait… I shouldn’t really… um...</p><p>Anyway, Kiva is awesome, I’ve seen him fight a couple of times, he’s AMAZING!  He kicks the tails of anyone who steps up… if… er… when he’s sober.  And I just… I dunno… I feel really safe when he’s around.  Not like… um… well, he makes me feel safe.  That’s all.</p>"

For some reason.</p><p>Is it because he owes me 11 watts? No… it was something else. Something good? Yeah it’s definitely a good thing. Like he's definitely not a bad guy...</p><p>...</p><p>No!

You wanna hear about the latest thing I’ve been working on?</p><p>Okay yeah no so get this right?  First, you get a whole bunch of little ball bearings, and you put them all into a bucket, and then you swing it around and swish it left and right! So when you have enough of them, see how all the little balls, moving collectively, they behave really similarly to water, right? Right! So you know what I think, I think that means that water is actually made up of like, billions of little tiny spherical things!  Like super tiny!  So tiny that you can’t even really see the - n-no, I’m getting to that, shush.</p><p>Sorry, where was I?  Um… well, it’s gone.</p><p>Tomomi!  Get that out of your mouth right now!</p>"

Some of us are just fucked right from the start.</p><p>I can't say I really get what's going on inside her head, what with her \"gremlins\" and the forgetting stuff and the blanking out and the acting out, but she deserves just as much of a chance as everyone else.</p>"

He taught me a LOT about how cables work, like how you can just plug stuff in and how the special magic converts watts into other stuff and makes things do stuff? It’s amazing! And how cables can just kinda be tied back together again after they've been cut! Cyrus was a pretty nice guy! It’s sad that he disappeared. I always wondered what happened to him. People disappear all the time in Kuserra, though – it’s still sad, though.</p><p>I actually didn't even know Cyrus had a daughter. Well, he never mentioned her anyway, and she never came around when I was there. I actually met Riley through Kiva, who I met a few years after Cyrus disappeared. Well, kinda, I mean, I never really \"met\" her. I still really never really, like, talked to her much… cuz she’s kinda weird? I mean, she didn’t talk to me much either, so we just kinda never said anything to each other? I mean she smiles a lot. Like, waaaaaaaaay, way too much. It’s kinda creepy. And people say there’s all these loud noises coming from her workshop too, like explosions and stuff? Everyone says to stay away from it. Everyone says that you should stay away from her too, otherwise you’ll become crazy like her? But Kiva's not crazy. So I don’t know if her crazy is really catchable? I dunno how that all works.</p><p>Anyway, based on what Kiva’s told me, I guess something bad happened and like… Riley went to go live with Kiva and Kiera for a while? Cuz she got hurt, or something... and – Oh Yeah! Kiva told me Kiera was still living with him then too… But then Kiva took her back to Cyrus’s old workshop and so Riley lives there now. But Kiva still checks in on her a lot. Like, he really worries about her, I think. It’s kind of sweet really.</p>"
